🔌 Power & Regulation
Outdoor Unit (Arduino + Sensors)

Input: 9–12V DC

Regulated using LM7805 → 5V rail for sensors + Arduino

Noise filter capacitors recommended (100 µF + 0.1 µF)

Indoor Unit (ESP32)

Powered via 5V USB Adapter (2A recommended)

Shared ground with outdoor unit via 5m cable

🛠️ Assembly Notes

Use weatherproof enclosures with cable glands for all external cables.

Bearings should be lightly lubricated for long-term stability.

Shielded twisted pair cable reduces noise on long serial runs.

UV sensor requires a small UV-transparent cover (e.g., acrylic).

Align wind vane magnet precisely for accurate direction mapping.
