# IoT-Based-Weather-Station
This project presents an IoT-based weather monitoring system designed to collect, analyze, and visualize real-time environmental data. The system continuously measures parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light intensity, transmitting the data to a cloud platform for remote access and monitoring.
